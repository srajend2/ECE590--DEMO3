Please run the Initial_Trigger_Reception.py file first which would keep reading the UDP socket for a datagram received from Walking Robot. If data is OK, then it would acknowledge that data received is OK to the walking robot and would trigger InvKin_Control.py file and start picking up the box and would place it in the precoded destination. If received data is not OK then it would acknowledge the same to the walking robot.
